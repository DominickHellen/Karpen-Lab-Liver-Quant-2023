# An improved method for quantitative analysis of liver pathology

This repository contains all files for Bio-Protocol ([DOI: 10.21769/BioProtoc.4776](https://bio-protocol.org/en/bpdetail?id=4776&type=0)). Included are scripts for automated batch quantification of whole-slide scanned liver sections for the purpose of understanding differences in pathology within hepatobiliary development and disease.

**Detailed use of each script is outlined within [Bio-Protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/en/bpdetail?id=4776&type=0).**
>>Briefly: After creating a new project within Qupath, move desired '.groovy' files into the 'scripts' folder. Within Qupath, the scripts should now be available to use. Once outlined regions of interest have been optimized for intensity (using the intensity script), click the detection script that matches the desired analysis (i.e. Macrophages, Cholangiocytes, Fibrosis), and then run. Each .GROOVY file used for anlaysis contains detailed notes that highlight each line's function.
